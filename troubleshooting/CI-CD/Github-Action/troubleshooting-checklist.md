# GitHub Actions Troubleshooting Checklist

## Workflow Triggering Issues

### Issue: Workflow Not Triggering
- **Check:** Confirm that the events specified in `on:` are correct and the conditions are met.
- **Solution:** Ensure the workflow is configured to trigger on the right events, such as `push`, `pull_request`, or others.

### Issue: Schedule Triggers Not Running
- **Check:** Validate the cron syntax in the `schedule` event.
- **Solution:** Correct any cron syntax issues and consider time zone differences (all times are UTC).

## Runner Issues

### Issue: Jobs Not Starting
- **Check:** Check if concurrent usage limits for runners have been reached.
- **Solution:** Optimize job concurrency or increase the limits of self-hosted runners if necessary.

### Issue: Runner Connectivity Problems
- **Check:** For self-hosted runners, ensure network connectivity and GitHub accessibility.
- **Solution:** Diagnose network issues and check firewall or proxy configurations.

## Execution Issues

### Issue: Step Fails to Execute
- **Check:** Examine error messages and logs for the failed step.
- **Solution:** Fix any script errors, dependency issues, or environment-related problems.

### Issue: Timeout During Step Execution
- **Check:** Verify if the step is taking longer than the `timeout-minutes` setting.
- **Solution:** Increase `timeout-minutes` or optimize the execution time of the step.

## Dependency and Environment Issues

### Issue: Missing Dependencies
- **Check:** Ensure that all required dependencies are installed in the correct step.
- **Solution:** Install missing dependencies or use a Docker container with the environment preconfigured.

### Issue: Environment Variables Not Set
- **Check:** Verify that all required environment variables are declared.
- **Solution:** Set the environment variables using `env:` or configure secrets if they are sensitive.

## Action-specific Issues

### Issue: Third-party Action Failing
- **Check:** Look for open issues in the action's repository.
- **Solution:** Update to the latest version of the action or switch to an alternative action.

### Issue: Custom Action Not Working
- **Check:** Confirm that the actionâ€™s Dockerfile or JavaScript files are error-free.
- **Solution:** Debug the custom action code and ensure it is tested thoroughly before use.

## Permissions and Security Issues

### Issue: Permission Denied Errors
- **Check:** Ensure the `GITHUB_TOKEN` has appropriate permissions for the operations.
- **Solution:** Adjust the token permissions in the repository settings or use a custom PAT with necessary scopes.

## Cache Issues

### Issue: Cache Not Restoring
- **Check:** Validate the cache key and the conditions for cache restoration.
- **Solution:** Ensure the cache key matches and there are no changes that would skip cache restoration.

## Best Practices for Avoiding Issues

- Use action versions pinned by SHA to avoid unexpected changes.
- Break down complex workflows into smaller, more manageable jobs or steps.
- Document each step in your workflows for clarity.
- Utilize matrix builds to test across multiple environments or versions.
- Regularly update actions to their latest versions after testing.
- Monitor the GitHub Status Page for any ongoing incidents that could affect Actions.
