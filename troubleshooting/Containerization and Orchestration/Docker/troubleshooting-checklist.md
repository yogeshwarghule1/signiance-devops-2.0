# Docker Troubleshooting Checklist

## Docker Volume Issues

### Issue: Volume not mounting correctly
- **Check:** Confirm the volume path in the `docker run` command or `docker-compose.yml` file.
- **Solution:** Correct the path and ensure proper permissions.

### Issue: Data persistence problems
- **Check:** Verify that you are using named volumes for persistent data.
- **Solution:** Switch to named volumes if using container-specific volumes.

### Issue: Volume permission denied
- **Check:** Check the ownership and permissions of the mounted volume directory on the host.
- **Solution:** Adjust permissions using `chown` or `chmod` on the host system.

## Docker Networking Issues

### Issue: Container not reachable
- **Check:** Inspect the container's network settings with `docker network inspect`.
- **Solution:** Ensure the container is connected to the correct network.

### Issue: Port conflicts
- **Check:** Check for conflicting ports with `docker ps`.
- **Solution:** Change the host port or stop the conflicting container.

### Issue: Inter-container communication fails
- **Check:** Verify that containers are on the same network.
- **Solution:** Connect containers to the same network or use `--link` to facilitate communication.

## Docker Image Issues

### Issue: Image not found
- **Check:** Confirm the image name and tag.
- **Solution:** Pull the correct image or build it if it's a custom image.

### Issue: Image build fails
- **Check:** Examine the Dockerfile for errors.
- **Solution:** Fix the Dockerfile and try rebuilding.

## Docker Container Issues

### Issue: Container unexpectedly exits
- **Check:** Run `docker logs <container>` to check for error messages.
- **Solution:** Resolve the errors indicated in the logs.

### Issue: Container running but not functioning as expected
- **Check:** Ensure all environment variables are correctly set.
- **Solution:** Use `docker inspect <container>` to review environment variables.

## General Docker Practices

- Regularly remove unused containers, networks, and volumes to free space.
- Keep Docker and container images up to date.
- Use `.dockerignore` files to speed up builds and avoid adding unnecessary files.
- Document your Docker configurations to facilitate easier troubleshooting.
