# AWS CodePipeline Troubleshooting Checklist

## Pipeline Setup Issues

### Issue: Pipeline Fails to Start
- **Check:** Confirm the pipeline’s source stage is correctly configured with the source repository and branch.
- **Solution:** Ensure that webhooks are properly set up for change detection, and IAM roles have necessary permissions.

### Issue: Inadequate Permissions
- **Check:** Verify the IAM roles and policies associated with the pipeline allow for necessary actions.
- **Solution:** Update IAM roles and policies to grant the necessary permissions for CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and deployment resources.

## Build and Test Issues

### Issue: Build Stage Failing
- **Check:** Review the build logs in AWS CodeBuild for errors.
- **Solution:** Correct any errors in the buildspec.yml or package dependencies.

### Issue: Test Commands Failing
- **Check:** Ensure test commands and environment variables are correctly specified in the buildspec.yml.
- **Solution:** Fix any test script errors and make sure all environment variables are defined.

## Deployment Issues

### Issue: Deployment Stage Fails
- **Check:** Inspect the logs for the deployment stage to identify the error.
- **Solution:** Resolve issues such as incorrect configuration, insufficient permissions, or resource limitations.

### Issue: Resource Limit Errors
- **Check:** Determine if resource limits in the target environment are being exceeded.
- **Solution:** Request a limit increase or optimize resource usage.

## Artifact Issues

### Issue: Artifact Not Found
- **Check:** Confirm that the artifact name and path match those specified in preceding stages.
- **Solution:** Correct the artifact reference and ensure it’s being passed between stages.

### Issue: S3 Bucket Access Denied
- **Check:** Verify permissions on the S3 bucket used for storing pipeline artifacts.
- **Solution:** Update the S3 bucket policy to allow access from the pipeline.

## Notification and Monitoring Issues

### Issue: No Notifications on Failure
- **Check:** Ensure notification rules are set up to alert on pipeline state changes.
- **Solution:** Configure Amazon SNS topics and subscription for pipeline notifications.

### Issue: CloudWatch Alarms Not Triggering
- **Check:** Check the CloudWatch alarm configuration tied to the pipeline.
- **Solution:** Adjust CloudWatch alarms to correct thresholds and ensure they are linked to the right metrics.

## Third-Party Integration Issues

### Issue: Integrations with Third-Party Services Failing
- **Check:** Confirm the integration’s configuration and credentials are correct.
- **Solution:** Update service roles, regenerate API tokens, and reconfigure integrations as necessary.

## General Tips and Best Practices

- Keep your AWS CLI and SDKs up to date to avoid compatibility issues.
- Regularly audit your pipeline for any IAM roles and policy changes.
- Make sure to check AWS service quotas and request increases well before they are needed.
- Isolate and replicate the problem in a non-production environment, if possible, to understand the root cause without affecting your production workload.
- Utilize AWS CodePipeline's built-in encryption for sensitive data and do not store such data in your buildspec.yml or appspec.yml files.
