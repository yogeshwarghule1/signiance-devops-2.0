# Kubernetes Troubleshooting Guide

## Cluster Issues

### Unable to connect to the cluster
- **Check:** Verify the `kubectl` configuration (`kubectl config view`).
- **Check:** Ensure the cluster API server is accessible from your machine.
- **Solution:** Review the running status of the cluster (`kubectl cluster-info`).

### Node Issues

#### Node is in `NotReady` state
- **Check:** Verify if `kubelet` is running on the node.
- **Check:** Inspect node status (`kubectl get nodes`) and node logs.
- **Solution:** Address any errors found in the logs and ensure the node is correctly configured.

## Workloads

### Pods

#### Pod stays in `Pending` state
- **Check:** Examine cluster resources for adequacy and investigate pod events (`kubectl describe pod`).
- **Check:** Verify storage class availability for any attached volumes.
- **Solution:** Ensure sufficient resources and storage, and that the pod's node selector matches available nodes.

#### `CrashLoopBackOff` status in pods
- **Check:** Inspect pod logs (`kubectl logs <pod_name>`) for error messages.
- **Check:** Examine the events of the pod (`kubectl describe pod <pod_name>`).
- **Solution:** Validate resource constraints and application health; fix any identified application bugs.

### Services

#### Service is not accessible
- **Check:** Validate service configuration and that the service selector matches pod labels.
- **Check:** Check firewall rules and network policies.
- **Solution:** Confirm port configurations and ingress resources if necessary.

## Security

### Unauthorized (RBAC-related issues)
- **Check:** Verify RBAC permissions for the user and role bindings (`kubectl get roles`, `kubectl get rolebindings`).
- **Solution:** Update RBAC settings and ensure the correct context is used in `kubectl`.

## Networking

### DNS Resolution Issues
- **Check:** Ensure CoreDNS or kube-dns pods are running and check DNS configuration within pods.
- **Solution:** Verify service and pod names are correct, and that DNS service is properly configured.

### Ingress Controller Misconfiguration
- **Check:** Review ingress resource for syntax errors and ingress controller logs.
- **Solution:** Verify proper annotations and backend service configurations.

## Storage

### PersistentVolumeClaim is `pending`
- **Check:** Check the availability and status of the storage class.
- **Check:** Verify storage provisioner configuration.
- **Solution:** Ensure enough storage capacity in the cluster and proper PVC to PV binding.

### Volume/Storage Issues
- **Check:** Use `kubectl get pv,pvc` to check status and bindings.
- **Solution:** Verify access modes and storage class details, and check for any storage capacity issues.

## Configuration

### ConfigMap or Secret not found
- **Check:** Verify the resource name and namespace (`kubectl get configmaps`, `kubectl get secrets`).
- **Solution:** Check if the resource was created at the expected time.

## Application Deployment

### Invalid YAML Syntax
- **Check:** Use YAML linters to validate your configuration.
- **Check:** Double-check indentation and syntax.
- **Solution:** Inspect error messages for details and adjust the YAML file accordingly.

## Custom Resources

### Custom Resource Definition (CRD) Not Found
- **Check:** Check if the CRD is installed (`kubectl get crds`).
- **Solution:** Verify the API group and version, and ensure the CRD manifest is applied correctly.

## Performance

### Insufficient CPU or Memory
- **Check:** Inspect resource requests and limits in pod specs.
- **Check:** Verify node capacity and resource utilization.
- **Solution:** Resize the resources or adjust the resource quotas as necessary.

## External Access

### Unable to create LoadBalancer Service
- **Check:** Verify cloud provider credentials and check if LoadBalancer services are supported.
- **Solution:** Check the cloud environment and troubleshoot the service configuration.

## Scheduling

### Node Affinity or Anti-Affinity Issues
- **Check:** Check node affinity or anti-affinity rules in pod specifications.
- **Solution:** Ensure that nodes have the required labels to satisfy affinity rules.

## Monitoring and Logging

### Monitoring System Encountered Downtime
- **Check:** Verify the health and status of monitoring pods and services.
- **Solution:** Check logs for the monitoring system and investigate any outages or configuration errors.

## General Best Practices

- Keep Kubernetes components and tools updated.
- Regularly review cluster and application logs.
- Document all cluster configurations and changes.
- Implement monitoring and alerting for early detection of issues.
- Engage with the Kubernetes community
