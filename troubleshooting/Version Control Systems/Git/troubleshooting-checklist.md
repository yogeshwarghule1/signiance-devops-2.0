# Git Troubleshooting Checklist

## Common Issues and Resolutions

### Issue: Unable to push to the repository
- **Check:** Confirm you have the correct access rights to the repository.
- **Check:** Verify the remote URL using `git remote -v`.
- **Solution:** Ensure you have push access and the remote URL is correct.

### Issue: Merge conflicts
- **Check:** Identify the files with conflicts.
- **Solution:** Manually resolve the conflicts in the listed files and merge changes.

### Issue: Commit not appearing in history
- **Check:** Confirm the commit SHA with `git log`.
- **Check:** Verify you are on the correct branch.
- **Solution:** If the commit is missing, it may be on a different branch. Switch to the correct branch.

### Issue: Changes not staged for commit
- **Check:** Use `git status` to see unstaged changes.
- **Solution:** Stage the changes with `git add <file>` before committing.

### Issue: Accidental commit to the wrong branch
- **Solution:** Use `git cherry-pick` to apply the commit to the correct branch or `git reset` to undo the commit.

### Issue: Git operations taking a long time
- **Check:** Large files in the repository.
- **Solution:** Use Git LFS for large files or clean up the repository.

### Issue: Lost commits or branches
- **Check:** Use `git reflog` to find lost commits.
- **Solution:** Checkout to the lost commit or branch.

### Issue: Authentication failures
- **Check:** Verify your credentials.
- **Solution:** Re-enter your credentials, create a new token if using two-factor authentication, or update stored credentials.

## Best Practices for Avoiding Issues

- Regularly pull changes from the remote to stay up-to-date.
- Avoid working directly on the main branches; use feature branches.
- Commit small, incremental changes to make tracking easier.
- Use meaningful commit messages.
- Frequently backup your repository.

Remember, for most issues, the `git status`, `git log`, and `git diff` commands are your best initial diagnostic tools.
