# Jenkins Troubleshooting Checklist

## Job and Pipeline Issues

### Issue: Build Failing
- **Check:** Review console output for errors.
- **Solution:** Fix any scripting, compilation, or test failures highlighted in the build log.

### Issue: Build Not Triggering
- **Check:** Verify job trigger settings (e.g., SCM poll, webhook).
- **Solution:** Correct job configurations and ensure webhooks are correctly set up if using.

### Issue: Pipeline Stuck or Hanging
- **Check:** Inspect for resource limitations, waiting for executors, or input steps.
- **Solution:** Increase resources, parallelize tasks, or ensure input steps are correctly configured.

## SCM Issues

### Issue: SCM Checkout Fails
- **Check:** Validate repository URL and credentials.
- **Solution:** Update SCM settings with the correct repository URL and valid credentials.

### Issue: Incorrect Branch Being Built
- **Check:** Confirm the branch specification in job configuration.
- **Solution:** Update job configuration to track the correct branch.

## Agent and Executor Issues

### Issue: No Executors Available
- **Check:** Check for offline nodes or executors busy with other jobs.
- **Solution:** Bring nodes back online or increase the number of executors.

### Issue: Agents Disconnecting
- **Check:** Review agent logs and network connectivity.
- **Solution:** Diagnose and resolve network issues, or restart agents if needed.

## Plugin Issues

### Issue: Plugin Compatibility
- **Check:** Ensure plugin versions are compatible with your Jenkins version.
- **Solution:** Update plugins and Jenkins to compatible versions.

### Issue: Plugin Feature Not Working
- **Check:** Look at the plugin documentation and issue trackers for known issues.
- **Solution:** Apply fixes or workarounds provided by the plugin maintainers.

## Security and Access Issues

### Issue: Access Denied Errors
- **Check:** Verify user permissions and role-based access control settings.
- **Solution:** Update security settings to grant the necessary permissions.

### Issue: Credentials Not Working
- **Check:** Confirm that credentials are correctly stored and scoped.

- **Solution:** Troubleshoot network issues, check firewall settings, and ensure Jenkins is running.

### Issue: Artifact Upload/Download Issues
- **Check:** Verify network connectivity to artifact repositories.
- **Solution:** Correct repository URLs, check credentials, and network paths.

## Performance Issues

### Issue: Slow Jenkins Performance
- **Check:** Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, disk space).
- **Solution:** Optimize jobs, clean up old builds, or scale up Jenkins resources.

### Issue: Long Queue Times for Jobs
- **Check:** Examine the build queue and job configurations.
- **Solution:** Parallelize jobs, increase executors, or optimize job triggering conditions.

## Integration Issues

### Issue: Issues with Integrated Tools (e.g., testing tools, code analysis)
- **Check:** Verify tool configurations and path in Jenkins.
- **Solution:** Ensure that Jenkins has correct access to the tool and that the tool is properly installed and configured.

## Miscellaneous Issues

### Issue: Jenkins Upgrade Issues
- **Check:** Backup before upgrading and note any deprecated features.
- **Solution:** Follow best practices for upgrading, review upgrade guides, and restore from backup if necessary.

## Best Practices for Avoiding Issues

- Regularly backup Jenkins configuration and jobs.
- Keep Jenkins and plugins up to date while ensuring compatibility.
- Use Job DSL or Jenkinsfiles for code-based job configuration.
- Implement a disaster recovery plan.
- Isolate and secure Jenkins using proper network configurations.
